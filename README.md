# CanadaITA
This is an example project and is intended to show how people can collectively create solutions for elected representatives to enact. It is intended to show average non-Tech people how basic online collaboration works and that it is easily/freely available to use. This example will be how to tax the rich. It is expected that with only one person the project will take many years to complete. The idea is not for any one person to write the solutions; fork it and write what works for you. See www.governance.page for more info.

Deletions will be noted with strikethrough, additions are red and amendments are green.
